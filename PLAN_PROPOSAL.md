# Introduction

This paper outlines the planning and motivation behind the **Students Defense** game, a tower defense project designed by students of the "Programowanie" course at the Faculty of Mathematics, Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. This project serves as both a practical application of programming skills and a means to enhance teamwork.

# Game Overview

**Students Defense** is a tower defense game where players strategically place towers to prevent waves of student characters from reaching an endpoint on a map that resembles campus buildings. The gameplay will incorporate typical tower defense mechanics along with unique educational elements, potentially including mathematical challenges to unlock tower upgrades or other game features. While these educational components are still under development, they will aim to enrich the player's experience by integrating academic knowledge from the field of mathematics, reflecting our dedication to our studies.

# Motivation

The project was chosen due to a shared enthusiasm for the tower defense genre among the team members. It provides a platform to merge a popular form of entertainment with educational themes, particularly those that reflect our studies in mathematics. This combination offers a unique opportunity to enhance our group work skills, as the straightforward nature of the project allows us to focus more on learning effective collaboration and project management techniques. We hope to develop new skills while creating a fun and engaging product.

# Technical Aspects

We will utilize Python's `Pygame` module and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to develop the game. These technologies were selected for their suitability in developing simple graphical interfaces and managing game dynamics. Additional modules like `pydub` for audio integration and `numpy` for handling large data sets may also be incorporated to enhance the game's functionality.

# Project Plan and Milestones

The project will kick off with all team members contributing to the setup of a basic repository. Initial tasks include:

- **Initializing a repository**: Each member will make simple commits to add their surnames to the credits in the `README.md` file, ensuring everyone has proper access.
- **Specification document**: Creation of a document detailing necessary methods and attributes for classes, allowing team members to signal needed functionalities.
- **Creating plans and ideas files**: These documents will guide the division of labor and manage workflow effectively.

We aim to develop a playable prototype within the deadline imposed by the lecturer of June 6, 2024. A simple level with a straight path, one type of opponent, and one tower will help familiarize the team with the basic mechanics of object-oriented programming and the Pygame module. Further milestones will be established as the project progresses, allowing for adjustments based on team feedback and initial testing results.

# Team Roles and Management

Currently, roles are not strictly defined, allowing team members to explore various aspects of the project. This approach is intended to identify individual strengths and interests, which will guide the more detailed division of labor in later stages. Team management strategies and conflict resolution methods will be discussed in team meetings to ensure a cooperative and productive environment.
